# Project Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the "projects" feature that allows users to organize sessions into projects. Each project can contain multiple sessions, providing better organization and management capabilities.

## Files Created

### 1. Core Logic
- **`src/core/logic/project_handler.py`** - New class for managing projects, including creation, deletion, and metadata management

### 2. User Interface Screens
- **`src/core/screens/projects_window.py`** - Main project management interface
- **`src/core/screens/create_project_window.py`** - Interface for creating new projects
- **`src/core/screens/project_sessions_window.py`** - Project-specific session management

### 3. Utilities
- **`src/core/utils/migration.py`** - Migration script to move existing sessions to the new project structure

## Files Modified

### 1. Core Logic Updates
- **`src/core/logic/file_handler.py`** - Enhanced to work with project-aware file operations
- **`src/core/logic_root.py`** - Added ProjectHandler to the logic controller

### 2. User Interface Updates
- **`src/core/screens/create_session_window.py`** - Added project selection dropdown
- **`src/core/screens/main_window.py`** - Updated navigation to include project management
- **`src/core/gui_root.py`** - Added new screens to the application

### 3. Utilities Updates
- **`src/core/utils/file_utils.py`** - Added project-related utility functions
- **`src/main.py`** - Added migration check on application startup

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Project Management
- Create new projects with validation
- Delete projects (with safety checks)
- View project information and session counts
- Set current active project

### 2. Session Organization
- Sessions are now stored within project directories
- Each session includes project metadata
- Project-aware session loading and saving
- Session count tracking per project

### 3. User Interface Enhancements
- **ProjectsWindow**: List all projects with session counts and current project indicator
- **CreateProjectWindow**: Create new projects with name validation
- **ProjectSessionsWindow**: View and manage sessions within a specific project
- **Enhanced CreateSessionWindow**: Select project when creating new sessions

### 4. Data Structure Changes
- **New Directory Structure**:
  ```
  AppUsageGUI/
  ├── Projects/
  │   ├── No Project/
  │   │   ├── session1.dat
  │   │   ├── session1.hash
  │   │   └── ...
  │   ├── Project1/
  │   │   ├── session1.dat
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── Project2/
  │       └── ...
  └── User/
      ├── config.dat
      └── apps.dat
  ```

- **Enhanced Session Data**:
  ```python
  {
      'app_name': session_app_name,
      'time_spent': session_time,
      'session_version': session_version,
      'config': self.config,
      'time_captures': captures,
      'project_name': project_name,    # NEW
      'created_date': timestamp,       # NEW
      'last_modified': timestamp       # NEW
  }
  ```

### 5. Migration System
- Automatic detection of existing sessions
- Migration of old sessions to "No Project" project
- Preserves all existing session data
- Safe migration with rollback capability

## Navigation Flow

### New User Flow
```
MainWindow → ProjectsWindow → ProjectSessionsWindow → SelectAppWindow → TrackerWindow
         → CreateProjectWindow
         → CreateSessionWindow (with project selection)
```

### Updated MainWindow Options
- "Start new session" - Goes to app selection
- "Manage Projects" - Goes to project management
- "Continue previous session" - Goes to projects (then sessions)
- "Configure custom rules" - Settings (unchanged)

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing sessions are automatically migrated to a "No Project" project
- Old session data structure is preserved
- No data loss during migration
- Graceful handling of missing project information

## Benefits
1. **Organization**: Sessions grouped by project for better management
2. **Scalability**: Can handle many projects without cluttering interface
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add project-specific settings or metadata
4. **Backup**: Can backup/restore entire projects
5. **Analytics**: Project-level time tracking and reporting capabilities

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test migration with existing sessions
2. Test project creation and deletion
3. Test session creation within different projects
4. Test navigation between projects and sessions
5. Test data integrity after migration
6. Test with multiple projects and sessions

## Future Enhancements
- Project-specific settings and configurations
- Project-level time analytics and reporting
- Project export/import functionality
- Project templates
- Project collaboration features
