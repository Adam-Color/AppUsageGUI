# Workflow Changes Summary

## Overview
Changed the session creation workflow so that users select the project and session name **before** starting the timer, rather than after stopping it.

## New Workflow

### Previous Workflow:
1. MainWindow → SelectAppWindow → TrackerWindow (timer starts)
2. User stops timer → SaveWindow → CreateSessionWindow (project/name selection)
3. Save session → SessionTotalWindow

### New Workflow:
1. MainWindow → **CreateSessionWindow** (project/name selection first)
2. CreateSessionWindow → SelectAppWindow → TrackerWindow (timer starts)
3. User stops timer → SaveWindow (saves session) → SessionTotalWindow

## Changes Made

### 1. MainWindow (`src/core/screens/main_window.py`)
- **Changed**: "Start new session" button now goes to `CreateSessionWindow` instead of `SelectAppWindow`

### 2. CreateSessionWindow (`src/core/screens/create_session_window.py`)
- **Modified `on_confirm()` method**: 
  - Now sets up project and session name
  - Resets trackers for new session
  - Navigates to `SelectAppWindow` instead of saving immediately
- **Removed**: `session_save()` method (no longer needed for immediate saving)
- **Updated**: Button text and flow to reflect new purpose

### 3. SaveWindow (`src/core/screens/save_window.py`)
- **Enhanced `save()` method**:
  - Added logic to handle new sessions (not just continuing sessions)
  - New sessions are now saved for the first time when user chooses to save
  - Added proper session data creation for new sessions
- **Added**: Import for `__version__` module

## Benefits of New Workflow

1. **Better User Experience**: Users know exactly what project and session name they're working with before starting
2. **Clearer Intent**: Project and session naming happens when the user is focused on setup, not cleanup
3. **Consistent Flow**: All session metadata is established upfront
4. **Reduced Confusion**: No need to remember what you were working on when the timer stops

## Navigation Flow

```
MainWindow
    ↓ "Start new session"
CreateSessionWindow (Select project + session name)
    ↓ "Create Session"
SelectAppWindow (Select app to track)
    ↓ "Select"
TrackerWindow (Timer running)
    ↓ Stop timer
SaveWindow (Save session data)
    ↓ "Yes"
SessionTotalWindow (View results)
```

## Backward Compatibility

- **Continuing existing sessions**: Unchanged workflow
- **Project management**: Unchanged
- **Session analysis**: Unchanged
- **All existing functionality**: Preserved

## Testing Recommendations

1. **New Session Flow**: Test complete flow from MainWindow to SessionTotalWindow
2. **Project Selection**: Verify project dropdown works correctly
3. **Session Naming**: Test session name validation
4. **App Selection**: Ensure app selection still works after project/name setup
5. **Timer Functionality**: Verify timer starts and stops correctly
6. **Session Saving**: Test that sessions are saved with correct project and name
7. **Continue Session**: Test that continuing existing sessions still works
8. **Cancel Operations**: Test canceling at various points in the flow
