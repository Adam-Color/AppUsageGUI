# AppUsageGUI
### Application Runtime Tracker

This program tracks the runtime of a specified application, logging the duration the application is running over multiple instances, with unique sessions created by the user.

## Features

- Supports tracking the total runtime of any executable
- Supports continuation from previous sessions.
- User customizable tracking rules

## Installation

We now have proper installers for Mac OS and Windows!

Find them [here](https://github.com/Adam-Color/AppUsageGUI/releases)


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and needed on the Develop branch! Here is a TODO list:

1. Add ways to analyze app usage data in the app
2. Move to a single QT UI instead of multiple 'screens'
3. Add support for tracking more than one executable per session
